= Stopwatch

This is the server-side part of the application that allows for recording laps during run&bike events

== Requirements

- go 1.12 with `export GO111MODULES=on` or Go 1.13
- `Makefile` to run the build/tests/deploy
- `asciidoctor-pdf` to render the reports

== How to start the Database

````
$ make start-database
````

=== How to initialize the Database

````
$ docker exec -it stopwatch_db psql -U postgres
````

then run the statements of the `model/db.sql` and `model/races.sql` files into the terminal to create the tables and initialize the races.


== How to run it

The process to run the backend is pretty rudimentary for now. It could probably be improved in the future.

````
$ make build

$ ./bin/stopwatch --help

````

= Stopwatch

This is the server-side part of the application that allows for recording laps during run&bike events

== Requirements

- go 1.12 with `export GO111MODULES=on` or Go 1.13
- Makefile to run the build/tests/deploy
- docker-compose to start the database
- asciidoctor to render the reports

== How to initialize the Database

````
$ docker-compose up -d db

$ docker exec -it stopwatch_db /bin/bash -c psql
````

then copy the content of the `model/db.sql` file into the terminal to run the SQL statements that will create the tables, etc.


== How to run it

The process to run the backend is pretty rudimentary for now. It could probably be improved in the future.

````
$ make run

````
